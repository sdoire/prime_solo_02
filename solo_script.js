// Three Bugs
/*The first bug I noticed right away was that 'basePercent -1' was getting returned instead of just 
basePercent.
The second issue that I knew needed to be fixed had to be in the for loop since Atticus was
getting returned 4 times. I eventually figured out that there needed to be an 'i' added to the
calculateSTI(array).
Finally, the instructions asked for rounding on the 4th item, which wasn't happening. I added
math.round to that calculation, as well as newArray[2] since that was also returning some
long decimals.
I added the space in between the items and created a new stylesheet to change the style on
list items.*/
